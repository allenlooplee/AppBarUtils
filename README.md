===========

AppBarUtils provides out-of-box app bar behaviors/triggers/actions for Windows Phone SDK 8.0 or higher. They enable you to do command binding (also binding for other properties) for app bar buttons/menu items, make use of the built-in Blend SDK and 3rd party behaviors, and dynamically show different app bars for different pano/pivot items or based on different page states.
